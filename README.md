ML PROJECT - AIRLINE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION

This project analyzes airline customer satisfaction using a dataset that includes
various factors such as flight experience, service quality, and customer
demographics. The notebook employs data cleaning, feature engineering, and
machine learning techniques, specifically decision trees, to identify the key drivers
of customer satisfaction. The goal is to provide actionable insights that airlines can
leverage to enhance customer experience and satisfaction levels, ultimately
improving their service offerings and customer loyalty.
